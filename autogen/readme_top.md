# Rebble Emojis

This contains [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) [bitmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) created by members of the [Rebble](https://rebble.io/) community. These will be used in [RebbleOS](https://github.com/pebble-dev/RebbleOS) or potentially a language pack for PebbleOS.

Emoji files are in the `emojis` directory. All other files are to do with the auto-generating README file.

## Filename Convention

Each emoji has a small version (roughly 11x11px) and a large version (roughly 18x18px) and should be in `PNG` format.

The image filename should follow the format '`codepoint`-`sizecode`.png'

The sizecodes are `sm` for small and `lg` for large.

For example, the [star emoji](https://emojipedia.org/star) file in large would be called `2B50-lg.png`.
